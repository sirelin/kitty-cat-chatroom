## Prototype plan
Our chosen topic is a social media platform. The idea is as follows: a chatroom/forum type page, where you can post pictures, texts, videos and communicate with other people via messages, like a typical social media. The originality of the idea lies in its cute uniqueness - it is a Kitty Cat Chatroom. Just like there are cat cafes, this chat platform would be cat-themed. You can create your own cat character, customize its appearance, add different clothes and other things. The created kitty represents you when you make posts, communicate with other people and it exists on your profile.

The persona to whom our page is aimed is a 15-year-old girl Sofia, who wants to continue talking to her friends online after school. She likes drawing, photography, likes to keep lists of her favorite things and take pictures of her cat. Through our project, she could share her lists of favorite things, pictures of cats and her drawings with her friends.

The idea came from thinking about platforms like Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/, Twitter/X https://x.com/, Rate (formerly rate.ee), Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/. Instagram is mainly for sharing pictures and videos, now stories and reels have been added, and the daughter app Threads, which make Instagram a popular platform. Our Kitty Cat Chatroom is basically like a forum - the posting side is designed for specific topics and sections, the pictures would remain on the profile. The difference with Twitter/X is that it is not directly your page where you post tweets, but you take part in existing specific topics. The difference with Reddit is that you have your own profile and a cat, which is customizable. It is a platform aimed at teenagers, where you can share your interests and spend time using cute kitties.
